# Raspberry-Spy

## Introduction

design and implement a Raspberry Pi 3 based low-cost smart surveillance monitoring system. 
With RPi3 on board Wi-Fi, Pi Camera and Motion Eye OS you will be able to capture High Definition video and live stream video can be accessed/viewed using a web browser from anywhere by just entering the static RPi IP address.
The system can automatically initiate video recording, image capturing or send notifications if any kind of motion is detected.

our team has used Raspbian os and open cv(because open cv provides standaed things such as image capture,image manipulation and all these specifications meet our requirements)

## Operation

Capture image
Get distance information (clear vision of a photo)
Send collected data to the server (sending the motion video or picture to a server)
Process data
Get response 

## Main  module

Camera interfacing
image capturing
connecting with hardware
Motion detection

For accesing image we use twitter plateform because twitter api was easily available.

ENJOY !
